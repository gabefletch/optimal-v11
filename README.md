### Optimal v11 is still in active development.

[Optimal](https://dub.sh/optimal) is an open source online repository for modified Android and iOS apps/games, as well as movie and TV streaming, developed, maintained, and curated by [Gabe Fletcher](https://dub.sh/gabe). Versions 11+ of Optimal are designed in Figma and pushed to the web with Framer. This repository hosts HTML backups for every page of the Optimal project, both desktop "dsk" and mobile versions.

## üîó Quick Links
There used to be quite a few useful links here that are now broken during development.

## üì≤ Android and iOS Apps
Optimal curates third-party modified Android and iOS apps and games with paywalls removed and subscription-based content unlocked out of the box. This is achieved through CDN parsing of third party sites to avoid pointing users to sites containing malware or phishing tactics. All apps/games are thoroughly tested before a direct download link is added to Optimal.

## üçø Movies and TV Streaming
Optimal encourages the use of streaming to circumvent buying media on digital marketplaces that may be providing an inferior version of a work of film. Unfortunately, the vast majority of third-party streaming sites are also malware-ridden and full of phishing tactics. This is why Optimal endorses [movie-web](https://github.com/movie-web/movie-web), an open-source, ad-free, no-nonsense media scraper that has been thoroughly tested by Optimal Team.
