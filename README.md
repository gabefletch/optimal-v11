# optimal-v11
This is the open-source viewing repository for [Optimal](https://dub.sh/optimal) v11 HTM and JS source code, created with [Webflow](https://webflow.com).
### I don't see any code...
And you won't for a while. Optimal v11 constitutes a full re-write of assets from v10.0.4 to Webflow.

### Why Webflow?
Bootstrap offers the widest range of development freedom ever for both Optimal and its lead developer Gabe Fletcher. 

### Will the URL change?
Yes, but you probably won't notice it. Optimal and other projects by Gabe Fletcher use the [Dub](https://dub.sh) link shortening engine which will seemlessly redirect you to the new URL for Optimal when the time comes. This means you can continue using [dub.sh/optimal](https://readymag.com/optimal/splash) regardless of under-the-hood URL changes.

### If Optimal is free to access, how is development taking place on a paid tool like Webflow?
Gabe Fletcher is part of Webflow's Student Program and receives a license for Webflow for free. 

### What happened to Bootstrap Studio Development?
Despite Gabe Fletcher being a registered member of GitHub's Student Developer Program, Bootstrap Studio refused to recognize this. Webflow will also deliver a faster turn around time for updates and v10.0.4 to v11 asset migration than possible with Bootstrap by maintaining the same general codebase.
