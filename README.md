## üì≤ Android and iOS Apps
Optimal curates third-party modified Android and iOS apps and games with paywalls removed and subscription-based content unlocked out of the box. This is achieved through CDN parsing of third party sites to avoid pointing users to sites containing malware or phishing tactics. All apps/games are thoroughly tested before a direct download link is added to Optimal.

## üçø Movies and TV Streaming
Optimal encourages the use of streaming to circumvent buying media on digital marketplaces. Unfortunately, the vast majority of streaming sites are also malware-ridden and full of phishing tactics. This is why Optimal endorses [movie-web](https://github.com/movie-web/movie-web), an open-source, ad-free, no-nonsense media scraper that has been thoroughly tested by Optimal Team.
