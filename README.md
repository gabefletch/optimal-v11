# optimal-v11
This is the open-source viewing repository for [Optimal](https://dub.sh/optimal) v11 [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) source code, created with [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io).

### I don't see any code...
And you won't for a while. Optimal v11 constitutes a full re-write of assets from v10.0.4 to Bootstrap.

### Why Bootstrap?
Bootstrap offers the widest range of development freedom ever for both Optimal and its lead developer Gabe Fletcher. 

### Will the URL change?
Yes, but you probably won't notice it. Optimal and other projects by Gabe Fletcher use the [Dub](https://dub.sh) link shortening engine which will seemlessly redirect you to the new URL for Optimal when the time comes. This means you can continue using [dub.sh/optimal](https://readymag.com/optimal/splash) regardless of under-the-hood URL changes.

### If Optimal is free to access, how is development taking place on a paid tool like Bootstrap Studio?
Gabe Fletcher is part of the GitHub Student Developer program and receives a license for Bootstrap Studio for free.
