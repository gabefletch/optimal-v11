### Optimal v11 is still in active development.

[Optimal](https://dub.sh/optimal) is an open source online repository for modified Android and iOS apps/games developed, maintained, and curated by [Gabe Fletcher](https://dub.sh/gabe). Versions 11+ of Optimal are designed in Figma and pushed to the web with Framer. This repository hosts HTML backups for every page of the Optimal project, both desktop "dsk" and mobile versions.

## üîó Quick Links
There used to be quite a few useful links here that are now broken during development.

## üì≤ Android and iOS Apps
Optimal curates third-party modified Android and iOS apps and games with paywalls removed and subscription-based content unlocked out of the box. This is achieved through CDN parsing of third party sites to avoid pointing users to sites containing malware or phishing tactics. All apps/games are thoroughly tested before a direct download link is added to Optimal.

## üìí Documentation
Documentation for Optimal is available at Optimal Docs, via [dub.sh/optimaldocs](https://dub.sh/optimaldocs)<br>
Documentation at this link is extremely outdated, this site and all documentation is being rebuilt.

## ‚úÖ Dependencies
There used to be quite a few dependencies listed here that are now outdated during development.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal
Legal disclaimers, terms of use, privacy policy, and other legal clauses for Optimal can be found [here](https://dub.sh/optimal-legal).<br>
All legal terms will likely receive a rewrite upon release of Optimal v11.
